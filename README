Sinatra-S3 is an implementation of the Amazon S3 API.  Based on the
Parkplace, written by _why, Sinatra-S3 has been extended to provide
additional support for ACLs, versioning and a bittorrent tracker.

* A custom version of rubytorrent is required to enable bittorrent 
  support. see http://github.com/nricciar/rubytorrent.
